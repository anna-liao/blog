Hello! My name is Anna Liao. I am currently a DevOps SysAdmin for an OpenStack cloud at [Cybera](http://www.cybera.ca/), a non-profit Research and Education Network primarily funded by Goverment of Alberta and other Canadian government agencies. Cybera provides IT services for University, K-12, and startup entrepreneurs.

I live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, which is underrated as an amazing city for the outdoors enthusiast. We are in close proximity to the beautiful Canadian Rockies, and any mountain sport you can think of is available here.

## Open Source Projects

When I was learning Rust, I decided to work on a project to make the learning process more tangible and focused. The goal of my project was to write to an LED matrix on a Raspberry Pi in Rust. For the final working project, you can see my GitHub repo [writeLED-rs](https://github.com/anna-liao/writeLED-rs). I also presented on this project at the inaugural PyCascades 2018, [RaspberryPy to RustyPi](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/lUQ7YxnKo6C8Od).

I was an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern with The Wikimedia Foundation from Nov 2016 to March 2017. I worked on a parser for the Python open source project Pyslet and you can read more at my [project wiki](https://github.com/anna-liao/pyslet/wiki).

## Lawrence Berkeley Lab

At LBL, I was an engineer supporting research to inform energy policy. The two primary areas I worked in are 1) energy efficiency in residential and small commercial buildings and 2) smart grid and distribution grid.

## NASA Jet Propulsion Lab

I was a microdevices engineer working on sensor microfabrication. I _really_ liked the applications for my work, which included high temperature and radiation hard sensors and electronics for Venus. I attained many valuable skills at JPL including builing sensor prototypes end-to-end, optical and electrical characterization and data analysis.
