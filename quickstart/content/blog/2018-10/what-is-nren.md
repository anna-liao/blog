I recently attended a technical conference and it seemed most people have not heard of Research and Education Network (REN) organizations. I am an OpenStack cloud system administrator at [Cybera](http://www.cybera.ca/), a non-profit provincial REN serving Alberta-based academics, researchers, non-profits and small to medium sized organizations. We also have other projects serving other Canadian users, depending on where the project funding is from. Most of our funding is from Government of Alberta and other Canadian government organizations.

I primarily support our [cloud resources](http://www.cybera.ca/services/cloud-resources/). The Rapid Access Cloud (RAC) provides free cloud computing resources for any Alberta resident. Most of our users are University of Alberta and University of Calgary students and faculty. We also have some startups and hobbyists that prototype on our cloud. One project I am working on now is putting together example code and documentation for cloud independent development for our users. The purpose is to provide guidance on how to use configuration management and other software tools to make it easy to provision their web app, for example, on or migrate to and from multiple public clouds (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure).

You can read more about RENs at the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_research_and_education_network) page. [Internet2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet2) and [ESnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Sciences_Network) are U.S.-based NRENs. [SURFnet](https://www.surf.nl) is a prolific REN in the Netherlands, and we referred to the [SURFnet open source repos](https://github.com/SURFnet) when building our confederated identity and access management (IAM) service for Alberta K-12 schools.
